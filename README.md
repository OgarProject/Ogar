# Ogar
An open source Agar.io server implementation, written in Node.js.

## Project Status
The project is nearly complete. Here's a rough list of what's been done and what needs to be done:

- [x] Master server basic implementation
- [x] Game server basic implementation (clients can connect)
- [x] Single-cell movement
- [x] Randomly generated cells and viruses
- [x] Ejecting mass
- [x] Splitting
- [x] Multi-cell player movement
- [x] Cells eating other cells
- [x] Leaderboard
- [x] Team mode

## Known Issues
- [General] Spectator mode is not working
- [General] Several formulas for calculating variables (ex. speed) are incorrect
- [Team] Cells just block their team mates when colliding, instead of pushing them a little

## Obtaining and Using
As Ogar is written in Node.js, you must have Node.js and its "ws" module installed to use it. You can usually download Node using your distribution's package manager (for *nix-like systems), or from [the Node website](http://nodejs.org) (for Windows systems).

To install the "ws" module that is required, open up your system command line (cmd for windows, terminal for mac) and type "npm install ws".

Although Ogar allows you to run both the Agar.io master server and game server separately, it's currently recommended that you run both servers together until the master server is more implemented. Alternatively, you could run the game server only, and use a client-side mod to connect to the IP address of the server.

```sh
~$ git clone git://github.com/forairan/Ogar.git Ogar
~$ npm install ./Ogar
~$ node Ogar --master --game
```

Currently, Ogar listens on the following addresses and ports:
* *:80 - for the master server
* *:443 - for the game server

Please note that on some systems, you may have to run the process as root or otherwise elevate your privileges to allow the process to listen on the needed ports.

## Configuring Ogar
Ogar has a configurations field that can be modified. To do this, open up GameServer.js with a decent text editor (except for notepad), then go to line 35 to see the config values.
